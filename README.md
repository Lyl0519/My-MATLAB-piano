# My-MATLAB-piano

Hello guys!

The xlsxs in folder 'resources' are scores. There are some Jay Zhou's songs already in them. You can also create your own score following their format!

Folder 'piano88' contains 88 original sounds recorded from a real piano.

Run creat_scale.m first to convert them into a mat file with fourier parameters.

Then you can run play_mix.m to play the music!

(Variables: 'T_normal', 'tune' and 'sound_name' depend on your scores)

So reset them properly if you want to play different musics or songs.
