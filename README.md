# My-MATLAB-piano

Hello guys!

The xlsxs in folder 'resources' are scores. You can create your own score following their format!

Folder 'piano88' contains 88 original sounds recorded from a real piano.

Run creat_scale.m first to convert them into a mat file with fourier parameters.

Then you can run play_mix.m to play the music!

(remember to reset the variables: 'T_normal', 'tune' and 'sound_name', in play_mix.m if you want to play different music!)

Recommanded pace:

Rainbow 100
